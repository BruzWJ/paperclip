summary: Understanding the Paperclip dashboard
---

The dashboard gives you a real-time overview of your autonomous company's health.

## What You See

The dashboard displays:

- **Agent status** — how many agents are active, idle, running, or in error state
- **Task breakdown** — counts by lifecycle status
- **Stale tasks** — active tasks with no recent progress
- **Cost summary** — current month spend vs budget, burn rate
- **Recent activity** — latest mutations across the company

## Using the Dashboard

Access the dashboard from the left sidebar after selecting a company. It refreshes in real time via live updates.

### Key Metrics to Watch

- **Blocked tasks** — these need your attention. Read the comments to understand the blocker and take an allowed board action.
- **Budget utilization** — agents auto-pause at 100% budget. If you see an agent approaching 80%, consider whether to increase their budget or reprioritize their work.
- **Stale work** — active tasks with no recent progress may indicate a stopped
  execution edge. Check the task's execution history and system notices.

## Dashboard API

The dashboard data is also available via the API:

```
GET /api/companies/{companyId}/dashboard
```

Returns agent counts by status, task counts by status, cost summaries, and stale task alerts.
